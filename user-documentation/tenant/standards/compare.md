# Compare Tenant to Standard

When selected from the per-row actions on the [List Standards Templates](list-standards/) page, this report will provide you with an outline of the currently selected menu bar tenant against the standard template.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the standard must be set to "Report" for the system to collect the current settings from the tenant. Once report is set, it may take a couple of cycles for the orchestrator to correctly gather and apply any standards that are set to both Report and Remediate since the system will first Report before Remediate actions are taken.
{% endhint %}
